Interface
=============================
pywindow has three panels:

- Window Viewer displays the time domain and frequency domain representations of the selected window(s). The currently active window is shown in bold. 

- Window List lists the windows available for display in the Window Viewer. Highlight one or more windows to display them. The Window List buttons are:

  - **Add a new window** — Adds a default Hanning window with length 64 and symmetric sampling. You can change the information for this window by applying changes made in the **Current Window Information** panel.

  - **Copy window** — Copies the selected window(s).

  - **Delete** — Removes the selected window(s) from the window list.
